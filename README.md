# Steganography-and-Digital-Watermarking-for-Copyright-Protection-with-LSB-embedding-
## Problem Statement:
Digital images are easily copied and distributed over the internet, posing a significant challenge for creators to protect their intellectual property rights. This widespread and unauthorized distribution can lead to loss of revenue and recognition. Therefore, effective methods like steganography and digital watermarking are essential for embedding and protecting copyright information within digital images. This project is based on a basic understanding of steganography.

## Project Description:
This project demonstrates a simple technique for embedding and extracting watermarks in digital images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding. The primary goal is to protect copyright information by embedding a watermark into a cover image. The project includes functions to embed and extract the watermark, ensuring the watermark can be recovered to verify ownership.

### Features:
- Embedding Function: Embeds a watermark image into a cover image using LSB embedding.
- Extraction Function: Extracts the embedded watermark from the watermarked image.
- User Interface: Simple command-line interface to choose between embedding and extracting.
## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- **Make sure the code , cover_image ,logo are saved in same folder**
- **Make sure the side of the cover image and logo to be same**
## Installation
 - For Opencv : *pip install opencv-python*
 - For Numpy : *pip install numpy*
